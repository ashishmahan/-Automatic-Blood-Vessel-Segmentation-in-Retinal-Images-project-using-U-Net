# Automatic Blood Vessel Segmentation in Retinal Images-project using U-Net

Developed a system to detect and segment blood vessels in retinal images using the DRIVE dataset. Applied CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) for low-light enhancement and trained a U-Net model for precise vessel segmentation. Achieved high accuracy in segmenting vessels, even in low-light conditions. Future work includes converting the model to TensorFlow Lite for efficient deployment on mobile and embedded devices.
